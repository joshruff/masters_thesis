\chapter{CONCLUSION \label{cha:Summary}}

This work covered the development of a reference test bed for radio altimeter interference suceptibility testing which was validated by altimeter manufacturers and aircraft manufacturers. The test bed was automated in a modular framework which allowed rapid modification to enable testing under a wide range of conditions. Finally, this work covers the support the author gave to the execution, and analysis of data from radio altimeter tests. The reporting formats created supported the development of international standards for wireless avionics. These include: the International Civil Aviation Organization Standard and Reccommended Practices (ICAO SARPs), RTCA inc. Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (RTCA MASPS), and Minimum Operational Performance Standards (RTCA MOPS).  In the future, the wireless avionics equipment governed by these standards will allow air travel to become safer, more fuel efficient, and more economical.
