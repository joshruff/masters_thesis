This work was sponsored by the Aerospace Vehicles Systems Institute (AVSI) through Autho- rizations for Expenditure 76s1 and 76s2 (AFE 76s1/76s2). Project members contributed funding, equipment, and expertise without which the project would not have been completed.  Project members included Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, FAA, Garmin*, Honeywell Aerospace*, the  International Air Transport Association (IATA), Lufthansa Technik, NASA, Rockwell Collins*, Thales*, United Technologies Corporation, and Zodiac Inflight Innovations. The project members marked with an asterisk contributed the commercial radio altimeters tested in this work.

Thomas Meyerhoff from Airbus contributed the worst case landing scenario analysis covered in Section 2.5.2.1, and the summary of initial testing results shown in Figure 3.3. Dr. Chadi Geha provided the concept for the modified altimeter test setup shown in Figure 2.2.  All other work presented in this thesis was conducted by the author.
