\indent I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Huff, for giving me the opportunity to work in his lab throughout undergraduate and graduate school. Under his mentorship, my interest in electromagnetics developed into a passion which has driven my career. I would also like to thank Dr. Chamberland, who provided advice and professional guidance as I navigated undergraduate research and graduate school. Additionally, I would like to thank Dr. Fred Fisher and Dr. Dave Redman for their support over the years, especially through the transition period which followed Dr. Huff's move. Without them I could not have graduated when I did. Finally, I would like to thank my parents for their constant love and support while I attended graduate school.
