	abstract = {Today's wireless systems often require dynamic radiation characteristics such as high directivity, wide steerability, and large bandwidth, which are usually not achievable by single antenna frontends. Phased array technology offers a solution by combining multiple elements together in such a way that their radiation characteristics constructively interfere. Typically, the antenna elements are distributed periodically over lattice grids; however, this can lead to undesirable effects such as scan blindness and surface wave propagation. Instead, randomly distributing the radiators can attain the same performance increases without suffering from the detrimental effects of periodic structures. This work provides an analysis of the array behavior for planar triangular randomly distributed antenna arrays (TRA). A probabilistic theory is presented followed by numerical experiments from both the array factor analysis and Ansys HFSS finite-element simulations. Measurements of a prototype array system show main beam scanning capabilities.},

The 3-D transformation is modeled as a nonlinear stochastic system with the state estimate providing the six-degree-of-freedom motion and position values as well as structure. The stochastic model uses the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) as a nonlinear estimator and a screw representation of the 3-D transformation based on dual quaternions. Dual quaternions, whose elements are dual numbers, provide a means to represent both rotation and translation in a unified notation. Linear object features, represented as dual vectors, are transformed using the dual quaternion transformation and are then projected to linear features in the image plane. The method has been implemented and tested with both simulated and actual experimental data. Simulation results are provided, along with comparisons to a point-based IEKF method using rotation and translation, to show the relative advantages of this method. Experimental results from testing using a camera mounted on the end effector of a robot arm are also given.},

	abstract = {Although recently unequally-spaced arrays have been shown to be useful, the theory has not been fully developed, except for the use of matrices, computers, or the perturbation method. This paper presents a new approach to the unequally-spaced array problem. It is based on the use of Poisson's sum formula and the introduction of a new function, the "source position function." By appropriate transformation, the original radiation pattern is converted into a series of integrals, each of which is equivalent to the radiation from a continuous source distribution whose amplitude and phase distribution clearly exhibit the effects of the unequal spacings. By this method, it is possible to design unequally-spaced arrays which produce a desired radiation pattern. This method is effective in treating arrays of a large number of elements, and unequally-spaced arrays on a curved surface. Three examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. The problem of sidelobe reduction for the array of uniform amplitude, which was attacked by Harrington, is treated by our method. A numerical example is shown for 25-db sidelobe level. Also, the problem of secondary beam suppression is attacked with the use of the Anger function. The interesting problem of azimuthal frequency scanning by means of an unequally-spaced circular array is also shown, using the method of stationary phase.},

	abstract = {Various probabilistic properties of a large antenna array with randomly spaced elements have been studied. It is found that for almost all cases of practical interest the required number of elements is closely related to the desired sidelobe level and is almost independent of the aperture dimension, the resolution (or the beamwidth) depends mainly on the aperture dimension, and the directive gain is proportional to the number of elements used if the average spacing is large. As a consequence the number of elements required is considerably less than that with uniform spacings. Starting with a given number of elements and a given aperture size, it is possible to improve the resolution by a factor of ten, a hundred, or more by spreading these elements over a larger aperture with little risk in obtaining a much higher sidelobe level and a lower directive gain. In fact, this method offers a solution which is optimum in a certain statistical sense, i.e., all sidelobes are of equal level with equal probability. In addition, this analysis also gives a simple estimate of the sidelobe level of most nonuniformly spaced antenna arrays. In a number of such arrays studied by various investigators with high speed computers, the agreement found is remarkable.},

to investigate new distributed beamforming techniques. Platforms such as micro air vehicles (MAVs),
unattended ground sensors (UGSs), and unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs) can all benefit from advances in this area utilizing advantages in stealth, enhanced survivability and maximum maneuverability. Moreover, in this dissertation, electromagnetic radiation is investigated such that the signal power of each element is coherently added in the far-field region of a specified target direction with net destructive interference occurring in all other regions to suppress sidelobe behavior. This provides superior range and resolution characteristics for a variety of applications including; early warning radar, ballistic missile defense and search and rescue efforts.

A wide variety of topologies can be used to confine geometrically these mobile random arrays for analysis. The distribution function for these topologies must be able to generalize the randomness within the geometry. By this means it is feasible to assume the random element distribution of a very large volumetric space will yield either a normal or Gaussian distribution. Therefore the underlying assumption stands that the statistically averaged beam pattern develops from an arrangement of uniformly or Gaussian distrusted elements; both confined to a variety of geometry of radius A and is further generalized using a simple theory based upon the Fourier Transform. Hence, this theory will be derived and serve as the foundation for advanced performance characteristics of these arrays such as its ability for sidelobe tapering, adaptive nulling and multi beam control. In addition it will be shown that for the most ideal of conditions a steerable beam pattern free of sidelobe behavior (better known as a Gaussian distribution) is quite possible. As well these random array structures will be shown to provide superior bandwidth capability over tradiational array structures since they are frequency independent. Last of all a summary of the random array analysis and its results concludes this dissertation.},

This provides superior range and resolution characteristics for a variety of applications including; early warning radar, ballistic missile defense and search and rescue efforts.

A wide variety of topologies can be used to confine geometrically these mobile random arrays for analysis. The distribution function for these topologies must be able to generalize the randomness within the geometry. By this means it is feasible to assume the random element distribution of a very large volumetric space will yield either a normal or Gaussian distribution. Therefore the underlying assumption stands that the statistically averaged beam pattern develops from an arrangement of uniformly or Gaussian distrusted elements; both confined to a variety of geometry of radius A and is further generalized using a simple theory based upon the Fourier Transform. Hence, this theory will be derived and serve as the foundation for advanced performance characteristics of these arrays such as its ability for sidelobe tapering, adaptive nulling and multi beam control. In addition it will be shown that for the most ideal of conditions a steerable beam pattern free of sidelobe behavior (better known as a Gaussian distribution) is quite possible. As well these random array structures will be shown to provide superior bandwidth capability over tradiational array structures since they are frequency independent. Last of all a summary of the random array analysis and its results concludes this dissertation.},

	abstract = {Estimation of vehicle attitude during autonomous flying of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be performed with Global Positioning System (GPS). But when vehicle is flying this method results in error, hence another approach i.e., Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM) is used. But while extracting attitude (Euler Angles) of UAVs with DCM creates a drawback known as Gimbal lock which is also known as singularity problem in mathematics. This problem is due to deviation in one of the angles of attitude and leads to loss of degree of freedom. To avoid this problem the proposed technique is quaternion which represents orientation of a body. Quaternion, which is produced from rotation sequence of Euler angles and it implements Euler angles with any one of rotation sequences. This paper deals with the mathematical modelling and implementation of the quaternion in Matlab. Finally results are represented for each orientation in terms of Euler angles due to quaternion. This method is more accurate even body is under motion.},

The solution of the three-dimensional field is given in two forms: one as a Fourier series, and the other as a Bessel-Fourier series. The solutions are adapted to show how a prescribed horizontal pattern may be synthesized. In one method the pattern is represented as a Fourier series, in the other it is represented as a Bessel-Fourier series. It is also shown that by combining these two types of solution, it is possible to synthesize simultaneously a pattern in both the vertical and horizontal planes.},

In further tests incremental scanning was obtained through the use of phase shifters in the coaxial lens elements. The design of symmetrical three-dimensional lenses is briefly discussed.

However, in order to use statistical models in simulating or analyzing the performance of systems employing spatial diversity combining, information about angle of arrival statistics is also required. Ideally, it would be desirable to characterize the full spare-time nature of the channel. In this paper, a system is described that was used to collect simultaneous time and angle of arrival data at 7 GHz. Data processing methods are outlined, and results obtained from data taken in two different buildings are presented. Based on the results, a model is proposed that employs the clustered "double Poisson" time-of-arrival model proposed by Saleh and Valenzuela (1987). The observed angular distribution is also clustered with uniformly distributed clusters and arrivals within clusters that have a Laplacian distribution.},

The attenuation varied over a 60 dB dynamic range. A simple statistical multipath model of the indoor radio channel is also presented, which fits our measurements well, and more importantly, appears to be extendable to other buildings. With this model, the received signal rays arrive in clusters. The rays have independent uniform phases, and independent Rayleigh amplitudes with variances that decay exponentially with cluster and ray delays. The clusters, and the rays within the cluster, form Poisson arrival processes with different, but fixed, rates.
